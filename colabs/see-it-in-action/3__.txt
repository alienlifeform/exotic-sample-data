## Step 3: Run EXOTIC to generate a lightcurve

<font size=2>
ðŸ•”&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Estimated time: 2 minutes</i> (this would take longer with a real data set ~5-15mins)

EXOTIC will analyze the brightness of the target star in each telescope image to identify if there was a transit. At the end of this step, you will see your lightcurve as an image, and you can download the lightcurve data to your hard drive for submission to AAVSO.
