# If the user presses enter to run the sample data, download sample data if needed and
# put it into a sample-data directory at the top level of the user's Gdrive.  Count
# the .fits files (images) and .json files (inits files) in the directory entered 
# by the user (or in the sample-data directory if the user pressed enter).  If 
# there are at least 20 .fits files, assume this is a directory of images and display
# the first one in the series.  If there is exactly one inits file in the directory, 
# show the specified target and comp coords so that the user can check these against
# the displayed image.  Otherwise, prompt for target / comp coords and make an inits 
# file based  on those (save this new inits file in the folder with the output files 
# so that the student can consult it later).  Finally, run EXOTIC with the newly-made 
# or pre-existing inits file, plus any other inits files in the directory.
